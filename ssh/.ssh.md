## Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys

-   Before generating a new SSH key, you should check if you already have one. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter: ls ~/.ssh

-   If you see files like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub, you already have an SSH key pair. You can use the existing one or generate a new one if needed.

## Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key

-   If you don't have an SSH key or want to create a new one, use the following command to generate a new SSH key. Replace the email address with the one associated with your GitHub account: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mehedi@swordfishtech.co.uk"

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mh.web.mehedihassan@gmail.com"`

`ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mehedi@swordfishtech.co.uk"`

-   -t specifies the type of key to create (in this case, ed25519 for security).
-   -C is a comment to help you identify the key later.

## Step 3: Go to local user account and find .ssh file (it will be hiden)

### Windows

-   run this command: Press Win+R : %userprofile% or if linux then "c ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub"

    -   and open id_rsa.pub file
    -   then copy ssh key and paste github
    -   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
    -   cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

### Linux

Open the Terminal

-   ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
-   c ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub

## Step 4: IP ip-whitlisting-ingress (This is for only exos systen ltd)

-   Go to github endter organization and find ip-whitlisting-ingress repo and enter the ip here
