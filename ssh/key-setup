Step 1: Check for Existing SSH Keys
=> Before generating a new SSH key, you should check if you already have one. Open a terminal or command prompt and enter: ls ~/.ssh
=> If you see files like id_rsa or id_rsa.pub, you already have an SSH key pair. You can use the existing one or generate a new one if needed.

Step 2: Generate a New SSH Key
=> If you don't have an SSH key or want to create a new one, use the following command to generate a new SSH key. Replace the email address with the one associated with your GitHub account: ssh-keygen -t ed25519 -C "mehedi@swordfishtech.co.uk"
=> -t specifies the type of key to create (in this case, ed25519 for security).
=> -C is a comment to help you identify the key later.

Step 3: Go to local user account and find .ssh file (it will be hiden)
=> run this command: Press Win+R : %userprofile%
=> and open id_rsa.pub file
=> then copy ssh key and paste github
=> ssh-add ~/.ssh/id_ed25519
=> cat ~/.ssh/id_ed25519.pub
